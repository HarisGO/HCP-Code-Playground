### **How to Use the Advanced Coding Application**

#### **Getting Started**

To begin using the **Advanced Coding Application**, all you need is a modern web browser, such as **Google Chrome**, **Firefox**, or **Safari**. No installations or downloads are necessary, as this is a fully web-based platform. Just make sure you're connected to the internet, as some libraries (like **Brython** for Python, **CheerpJ** for Java, and **Blockly** for visual programming) are loaded from online sources.

#### **Interface Overview**

Once the application loads, you'll see a well-organized interface with two main sections: the **sidebar** and the **main content area**.

- **Sidebar**: On the left, you’ll find a vertical sidebar with buttons that allow you to select the programming language or tool you want to use. These buttons are clearly labeled, and each one has a **tooltip** that appears when you hover over it, providing extra information. You can choose from the following options:
  - **HTML/CSS**: Ideal for web developers looking to write and style web pages.
  - **JavaScript**: Perfect for interactive web elements and logic.
  - **Python**: For those learning or working with Python code directly in the browser.
  - **Java**: Use this for Java-based applications, compiled directly in the browser.
  - **Visual Programming**: A drag-and-drop interface for beginners, where you can create logic without writing code, which is then converted to JavaScript.
  
#### **Writing Code**

- **Code Editor**: In the main content area, you'll see an editable area for writing your code. The **Ace Editor** will automatically adapt to the programming language you select. It features **syntax highlighting**, **auto-completion**, and **line numbering**, making it easier for you to write clean code. If you're working in the **Visual Programming** mode, you will see an interactive interface for dragging and dropping logic blocks.
  
- **Live Feedback**: As you write code, the editor will instantly highlight syntax errors and provide tips on how to fix them. You can even save your work with the **Save** button and load previous projects.

#### **Running Your Code**

Once your code is ready, click the **Run Code** button. Depending on the language you've chosen:
  
- **HTML/CSS**: Your code will be displayed live in a preview pane within the app, so you can immediately see the changes to your web page.
- **JavaScript**: The application runs your JavaScript code directly in the browser, and the output appears in the console or a dedicated output area.
- **Python**: Using **Brython**, Python code is executed directly in the browser without the need for a server.
- **Java**: The Java code is compiled using **CheerpJ** and runs in the browser, similar to JavaScript.
  
If you're in **Visual Programming** mode, clicking "Run" will generate JavaScript code from the blocks you've arranged, and then execute it, displaying the result in the output area.

#### **Saving and Loading Code**

The application allows you to **save** your work and **load** it later. Simply press the **Save** button, and the code will be downloaded as a `.txt` file that you can store on your computer or share with others. When you're ready to pick up where you left off, press the **Load** button and upload your saved file to restore your code.

#### **Visual Programming (Blockly)**

For those new to coding or wanting to explore logic without worrying about syntax, the **Visual Programming** option uses **Blockly**. It allows you to drag and drop blocks that represent different coding functions (like loops, conditionals, and variables). These blocks are automatically translated into JavaScript, so you don't have to write any code yourself. This is especially helpful for beginners or students learning programming logic.

#### **Output and Debugging**

Once you run your code, you’ll see the output displayed in a designated area below the editor. If you're working with **HTML/CSS**, the results will be shown in an embedded browser window. For **JavaScript** and **Python**, you'll see the output either in the console or in a designated output section.

The app also includes real-time error handling, so if there’s an issue with your code, the editor will notify you with an error message or highlight the problematic code, helping you quickly fix it.

#### **Help and Support**

If you’re unsure about anything, there’s a **Help** button in the sidebar that provides quick tips and explanations. This button opens a **step-by-step guide** and explanations of the different features and buttons available in the app. You can also access a **tutorial** on how to use the editor for each language.

#### **Responsive Design**

This application has been designed to be **fully responsive**, meaning it works perfectly on desktops, laptops, and even tablets and smartphones. The interface adapts based on your screen size, ensuring that whether you’re working from a large screen or a small mobile device, the experience remains smooth and easy to navigate.

#### **Conclusion**

Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, this tool offers a comprehensive, easy-to-use platform for learning and experimenting with multiple programming languages. The combination of text-based coding, visual programming, and live output previews makes it an ideal solution for developers of all skill levels. Start writing your code, experiment with different languages, or learn the basics of programming through **Blockly’s visual editor**—the possibilities are endless!
